/*
When we talk about `CSS inheritance` it means controling of what is happening if there is specified for a property on an element without any value. The child element uses whatever value is assigned by its parent unless its value is specified.


There are many iheritable properties but those are in common:

azimuth
border-collapse
border-spacing
caption-side
color
cursor
direction
elevation
empty-cells
font-family
font-size
font-style
font-variant
font-weight
font
letter-spacing
line-height
list-style-image
list-style-position
list-style-type
list-style
orphans
pitch-range
pitch
quotes
richness
speak-header
speak-numeral
speak-punctuation
speak
speech-rate
stress
text-align
text-indent
text-transform
visibility
voice-family
volume
white-space
widows
word-spacing


The difference between the `currentColor` and `inherit` keywords when used with colour values is that the currentColor is expecting that it has one main limiting condution- only used where a value is expected, if a property does not accept a value, it will not accept currentColor as a value and for inherited keyword, it can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand all. Its value and property.


The revert, initial, and unset keyword values allow us a lot of shade in setting defaults for properties. Although they are not all universally supported yet, they can be useful to know and understand their differences.

There might not be any danger of using inherit as a value if the certain properties are inheritable but it may have any danger if we use it with those unheritable properties, like margins, padding, borders and backgrounds. And so with revert, initial and unset properties- they behave as using inherit.
