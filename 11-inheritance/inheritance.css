/*
When we talk about `CSS inheritance` it means controling of what is happening if there is specified for a property on an element without any value. The child element uses whatever value is assigned by its parent unless its value is specified.


There are many iheritable properties but those are in common:

azimuth
border-collapse
border-spacing
caption-side
color
cursor
direction
elevation
empty-cells
font-family
font-size
font-style
font-variant
font-weight

line-height
list-style-image
list-style-position

orphans
