1)`overflow`
  a) Overflow default values are: auto, visible, hidden, clip, and scroll.

  b)  We would use this property because sometimes, the content or a part of a webpage doesnâ€™t fit and exceeds the borders of its container. In that case, CSS provides us with a solution with its overflow property so we can handle the overflow problem.

  c) Overflow property is useful for clipping, hiding, or scrolling an element's content when the content is bigger than its own specified area.

  d) Note that the overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.


2) `clip`
  a) Clip default value is auto.

  b) We use this property to creates a rectangular window that shows a part of an element.
  c) And it is useful for creating a mask through which a section of an image is displayed.
  d) Clip property won't work for overflow:visible;


3)`clip-path`
  a) Clip-path default values are none, circle, url() in an svg, polygon or numbers.

  b) we use clip-path to create a clipping region which sets what part of an element should be shown.
  c) It is useful for specifying which part of the picture or the content to be shown instead of showing the complete area.

  d) We need to set a clip property before to make the clip-path property works effectivelly.


4)`text-overflow: ellipsis`
  a) Text overflow values are: clip, ellipsis.

  b) We would use it when the text can't fit inside of the content element.

  c) It is useful for decreasing the amount of text displayed. If there is not enough space to display the ellipsis, it is clipped.

  d) We need a clip property to be set before text-overflow: ellipsis works properly.

  Overflow:auto is the browser's default way to handle contents that are larger than its container

  An ellipsis a series of dots (...) that usually indicates an international omission of a word or a senteence wheras ellipse doesn't have anything to do with that but it is a regular oval shape with clip-path as a value.

  What makes `text-overflow` different from the other properties is that it only work with text.
