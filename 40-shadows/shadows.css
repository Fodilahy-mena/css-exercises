    /*There are two types of shadows:

      1. Box Shadows, or the shadows that run around or inside a box
      1. Text Shadwos, or the ghostly shadow outlines of text.

      Let's do some research on these shadowsâ€¦

      1. `box-shadow` and `text-shadow` have very similar value syntax. Where do they differ?
      They are different when using an inset and thickness value because it only works with box shadows.

      1. If I wanted to create a hard-edge shadow, one that looks like a solid border, what combination of values would I need to use?
      We can't do that because it doesn't support blur thickness.

      1. Is it possible to create a shadow on a circular element? What about a polygon?
      Yes It is possible but it doesn't work with a polygon which is a value of a clip.

      1. Is it possible to create multiple shadows on the same element?
      Yes It is possible if we use multiple values like (text-shadows: 10px 10px 0 blue, -10px -10px 0 red;)
