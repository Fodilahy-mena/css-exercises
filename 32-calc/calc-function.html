        This function saved a lot of headaches when it came out. It makes arithmetic easy, and reproducible, but where it really shines is in mixing units.
      </h4>
      <p>
        There are some questions that I have answered through my research:
      </p>
    </header>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            What values can a `calc()` function support?
          </p>
          <p>
            In calc() function there are many values that could be supported such us length, frequency, angle, time, percentage and number, or integer as it known.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            How can we control the mathematical order of operation (PEDMAS / BODMAS) in the function, so that something like `calc(2 + 3 * 4)` doesn't equal `20`, when it is instead meant to equal `14`?
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the PEDMAS / BODMAS rules this means we start to calculate from:
            B: Brackets first,
            O: Orders (i.e. Powers and Square Roots, etc.),
            DM: Division and Multiplication (left-to-right) and
            AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).
            So how it works is like 3 * 4 = 12 and + 2 that is why it gives 14.
          </p>
          <p>
            But to make it equal 20, we have add brackets with 2 + 3 as in `calc((2 + 3) * 4)` then it will give 20.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Can we use a `calc()` function to convert one type of unit to another type of unit?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes we do can use a `calc()` function to convert one type of unit to another type of unit.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If we want to convert a unitless number to a unit value, what do we have to do?
          </p>
          <p>
            If we want to convert a unitless number to a unit value, what do we have to do is calculate the unitless integer with a number that has an unit. For example --base-unit: calc(var(--columns) / 2 * 1rem);.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Why do the *plus* and *minus* operators inside the function need spaces around them?
          </p>
          <p>
            It is becauuse, it would be considered as a negative integer if there each of them don't have spaces around. For example calc(40% -20px); is considered invalide, because as the user agent know about it is that the percentage value followed by a negative integer, not an expression. So it should be calc(40% - 20px); or calc(40% + 20px);.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            How can we convert a value into a negative value?
          </p>
          <p>
            We can  convert a value into a negative value by using a css variable.
            Like this :root {
            --body-width: 55px;
          }
          </p>
          <p>
          .item {
            position: absolute;
          width: calc(-1 * var(--body-width));
          }
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Can the `calc()` function work with colour values? e.g. a light red plus a light red should equal a darker red.
          </p>
          <p>
            It work with some browsers like Firefox and Safary, but it doesn't work with the others.
