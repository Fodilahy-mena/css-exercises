        This function saved a lot of headaches when it came out. It makes arithmetic easy, and reproducible, but where it really shines is in mixing units.
      </h4>
      <p>
        There are some questions that I have answered through my research:

    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What values can a `calc()` function support?

          In calc() function there are many values that could be supported such us length, frequency, angle, time, percentage and number, or integer as it known.
        </li>
        <li>
          How can we control the mathematical order of operation (PEDMAS / BODMAS) in the function, so that something like `calc(2 + 3 * 4)` doesn't equal `20`, when it is instead meant to equal `14`?

          According to the PEDMAS / BODMAS rules this means we start to calculate from:
          B: Brackets first,
          O: Orders (i.e. Powers and Square Roots, etc.),
          DM: Division and Multiplication (left-to-right) and
          AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right) so how do we calculate it then 3*4 = 12 and + 2 that is why it gives 14
        </li>
        <li>
          Can we use a `calc()` function to convert one type of unit to another type of unit?
